1. **Introduction to Linear vs. Nonlinear Problems:**
   - **Linear Problems:** Characterized by a proportional relationship between applied loads and system response, using a fixed stiffness matrix. Solutions can utilize the superposition principle.
   - **Nonlinear Problems:** Involve changes in stiffness with deformation, requiring frequent recalculation of stiffness and making solutions computationally intensive. Solutions cannot be superimposed.

2. **Sources of Nonlinearity:**
   - **Material Nonlinearity:** Due to nonlinear stress-strain behavior, common in materials like rubber.
   - **Boundary Nonlinearity:** Occurs when boundary conditions significantly change during analysis, such as when contact between surfaces happens.
   - **Geometric Nonlinearity:** Arises when significant geometry changes (large deflections or rotations) affect structural stiffness and response.

3. **Nonlinear Problem Solving Approach in Abaqus:**
   - Employs the Newton-Raphson method to iteratively apply incremental loads, seeking equilibrium at each increment.
   - Analysis involves defined steps composed of increments, each solved iteratively.

4. **Equilibrium Iterations and Convergence:**
   - Abaqus evaluates equilibrium by comparing force residuals against a defined tolerance, refining solutions iteratively until convergence is achieved.

5. **Automatic Incrementation Control:**
   - Abaqus adjusts increment sizes automatically for computational efficiency based on convergence performance.

6. **Practical Guidelines for Increment Management:**
   - Suggests starting increments at 5-10% of total step time, adjusting increment sizes based on convergence success.

7. **Documentation and Additional Resources:**
   - Abaqus provides extensive documentation, including user guides, theory manuals, installation instructions, and scripting references, facilitating effective simulation use and customization.

### Sample Problem:
Write a program similar to the one in Abaqus/Standard to solve an elastic-plastic bar problem. The bar has a circular cross-section with diameters of 20 mm on one side and 40 mm on the other, with four equally spaced nodes along its 1-meter length. Apply various loads at these nodes. Validate the program's correctness by comparing the force-displacement diagram with Abaqus results and verifying stress and strain calculations within elements at different times.

Investigate the following scenarios:
- a) Solve the problem for a load equal to 1.5 times the yield force without iterations by adjusting increments. Determine the required number of increments.
- b) Determine the minimal number of iterations required to solve the problem for a load equal to 1.5 times the yield force, and identify how many iterations are necessary per increment.


The provided Python code defines a class named `FEMSolver`, which performs nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) based on the concepts described previously in the Abaqus presentation. Below is a thorough introduction to how this solver works and relates directly to the key points highlighted in the presentation:

### Overview:
This solver implements an incremental-iterative nonlinear analysis approach, similar to Abaqus Standard, using the finite element method (FEM). It solves structural problems by discretizing the geometry into elements and nodes, applying incremental external loads, and performing Newton-Raphson iterations to handle nonlinearities.

### Components and Steps:

1. **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
   - The solver requires:
     - `mesh`: The discretized structure containing nodes and elements.
     - `bc`: Boundary conditions defining fixed degrees of freedom (DOFs).
     - `external_force`: Applied forces on the structure.
     - Solver parameters (`n_increments`, `max_iter`, `tol`) that control incremental loading and iteration criteria for convergence.
   - It initializes displacement arrays (`U`), fixed degrees of freedom, and records history for later analysis.

2. **Applying Boundary Conditions (`apply_boundry_conditions`)**:
   - Adjusts the global stiffness matrix `K` and the residual vector `R` to reflect boundary conditions by:
     - Setting fixed DOFs to prescribed values.
     - Modifying equations to ensure correct displacement constraints.

3. **System Assembly (`assemble_system`)**:
   - Assembles the global stiffness matrix and internal residual forces from element-level calculations:
     - Each element calculates its stiffness (`ke`) and internal forces (`f_int`) based on current displacements (`U`).
     - Contributions from all elements are summed to form global system matrices.

4. **Nonlinear Incremental Solution (`solve`)**:
   - Implements incremental loading (load increments) and iteratively solves using Newton-Raphson method, similar to Abaqus Standard:
     - External loads are divided into incremental steps.
     - For each increment, the solver iteratively:
       - Assembles the global stiffness matrix and residual forces.
       - Solves the linearized equations for displacement increments (`dU`).
       - Updates the current displacement state.
       - Checks convergence by examining residual and displacement increment norms against a tolerance (`tol`).

   - Records displacement and force histories for each increment, eventually plotting the force-displacement curve.

### Result Interpretation:
- After completing all increments and iterations, the solver provides:
  - Maximum displacement, stress, and strain for the analyzed structure.
  - A visual force-displacement curve to interpret structural behavior clearly.

### Connection to Abaqus Presentation:
- This solver explicitly reflects the incremental-iterative approach described in the Abaqus presentation for nonlinear analysis:
  - Nonlinearities are handled through iterative updates and incremental loading.
  - The Newton-Raphson method ensures equilibrium at each increment, mirroring Abaqus Standardâ€™s numerical solution strategy.
  - Automatic incrementation and convergence checks closely align with the described practices in Abaqus, ensuring accurate and efficient nonlinear solutions.
